# Verify Complete — Evidence-Based Completion Check

Prevents overclaiming by requiring code-level evidence for each claimed feature. Run this BEFORE the claim hits a persistence layer (persistent state files, session notes, roadmap tracking) — once it's written, it propagates to future sessions unchallenged.

## When to Use

Pre-claim, not post-claim:

- BEFORE writing to persistent state files (any "Active Now" entry, completion status)
- BEFORE writing session notes that claim items are complete
- BEFORE updating roadmap item status in any tracking system
- BEFORE answering "how much of X is done?" / "is the feature ready?"
- After implementing a multi-item feature checklist
- When reporting status to stakeholders

Even one false "done" claim poisons your persistent state and propagates into future sessions.

**Note**: If your harness has a Stop hook that catches single-turn deploy claims (e.g. "deployed and verified" with no evidence command in the same turn), that handles simple cases. This skill handles the heavier case: multi-item checklists, persistent-state writes, status reports.

## Verification Recipes by Claim Type

Different claims need different evidence. Pick the recipe that matches the claim shape — generic "grep for it" is not enough for deploys, schema changes, or cron triggers.

### Deploy claim ("deployed and verified", "shipped to dev/prod")

```bash
# Verify the live endpoint returns expected content
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://{{your-app}}.example.com/api/health"
```

Pass criteria: HTTP 200 + JSON body. HTML response = auth redirect (auth issue). 5xx = function bundle missing or crashed.

### CI claim ("CI passed", "tests green", "workflow succeeded")

```bash
gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 3 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,name
```

Pass criteria: all recent runs show `status=completed`, `conclusion=success`. In-progress runs do not count — wait or use the Monitor tool.

### Database migration claim ("migration applied", "schema updated")

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute {{your-d1-db}} --remote \
  --command="SELECT name FROM d1_migrations ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5"
```

Pass criteria: the new migration filename appears in the result. Empty result or older names only = migration did not actually apply.

### Worker cron claim ("cron registered", "schedule active", "trigger live")

```bash
# Use your platform's API to verify the schedule registration timestamp
# For Cloudflare Workers, check the CF API schedules endpoint:
ACCT_ID=<account-id>
TOKEN=<oauth-token>
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${ACCT_ID}/workers/scripts/{{your-worker}}/schedules"
```

Pass criteria: `modified_on` >= the time of your last deploy. If `modified_on` is older than your deploy, the trigger is silently stuck — re-register with PUT [] then PUT [{...}]. The deploy tool's "Deployed triggers" output is NOT proof on its own.

### UI feature claim ("button works", "modal renders", "label updated")

Use chrome-devtools MCP — `new_page` → `navigate_page` → `take_screenshot` of the specific component. HTTP 200 and unit tests don't prove what the user sees. Visual verification is mandatory for any UI label/render change. Note: the same label is often rendered in multiple places (sidebar, page header, document title, tab labels, breadcrumbs) — grep ALL render sites before claiming a label change is done.

### Feature checklist item ("idea N is done", "X of Y features shipped")

```bash
grep -rn "<feature-keyword>" <project>/src/ --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js"
```

Pass criteria: at least one of [file path, JSX render site, state hook, API call]. Help-text-only = `[DOCUMENTED ONLY]`, not `[VERIFIED]`. CSS without JSX = `[PARTIAL]`.

### Schema/code change claim ("alert wires up", "logic updated")

```bash
# Smoke-test the relevant endpoint
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://{{your-app}}.example.com/api/{{endpoint}}/run"
# Confirm the action was logged in your audit table
npx wrangler d1 execute {{your-d1-db}} --remote \
  --command="SELECT * FROM audit_log ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 3"
```

Pass criteria: 200 from the endpoint AND a fresh row in the audit log. 200 alone doesn't prove the action happened — only the audit row does.

### Multi-item completion ("X of Y items done")

Run Steps 1-6 below. Do not skip Step 1 (listing claims explicitly) — that's where overcounting is caught.

## Steps

### 1. List Claims

Write out each feature being claimed as complete:
```
1. [CLAIMED] Search input in grid view
2. [CLAIMED] Color legend button
3. [CLAIMED] Product filter dropdown
...
```

### 2. Code Verification (Per Feature)

For each claimed feature, provide evidence:

```bash
# Search for the implementation
grep -r "searchText\|search-input\|filterText" project/src/ --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" -l
```

Evidence categories:
- **Component exists**: File path + key JSX snippet
- **State wired**: useState/useEffect for the feature
- **UI renders**: JSX that produces visible output
- **API connected**: fetch/endpoint call if needed
- **CSS styled**: Relevant class names exist

Mark each as:
- `[VERIFIED]` — code exists, renders, connected
- `[PARTIAL]` — code exists but incomplete (missing CSS, no API, etc.)
- `[NOT FOUND]` — claimed but no code evidence
- `[DOCUMENTED ONLY]` — help text exists but no implementation

### 3. Build Verification

```bash
cd <project> && npm run build
```

Build passing does NOT mean features work — it only means no syntax errors.

### 4. Lint Verification

```bash
cd <project> && npm run lint
```

### 5. Visual Verification (if Playwright available)

Take screenshots of the feature in action. If auth blocks access, note it and verify via code instead.

### 6. Report Honest Status

```
## Feature Verification Report

| # | Feature | Code | Build | Visual | Status |
|---|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Search  | Found in Dashboard.jsx:45 | PASS | N/A | VERIFIED |
| 2 | Legend  | NOT FOUND | - | - | NOT DONE |
| 3 | Filter  | Found but missing dropdown JSX | PASS | - | PARTIAL |
```

### 7. Correct Persistent State

If any items were previously claimed as done but are NOT VERIFIED:
- Update persistent state files to correct the status
- Update session notes if they contain false claims
- Update roadmap items if they were marked completed

## Anti-Patterns

- NEVER mark something as complete based on memory alone — always grep for code
- NEVER count help documentation as implementation
- NEVER count CSS without corresponding JSX as complete
- NEVER claim "done" without running build at minimum
- NEVER report X/Y completion without evidence for each X item

## Evidence Levels

| Level | Meaning | Required Evidence |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Verified | Feature works end-to-end | Code + build + visual or API test |
| Code Complete | Implementation exists | Code + build pass |
| Partial | Some pieces exist | Code exists but gaps identified |
| Not Done | No implementation | Grep returns empty or docs-only |
